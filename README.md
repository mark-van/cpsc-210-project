# Penance/Atonement

## Function

This application will create a list of tasks to complete in order to make reparations for the user's damaging habits. 
The application will start by asking a series of questions to determine who or what(ie. then environment, ethical 
companies, the hungry, the impoverished...) the user has harmed, and to what extent. From this questionnaire, a list of 
tasks will be developed. When a task is complete, it will be moved to the accomplishments list. If a user refuses a 
task, an image of the thing they harmed will appear on screen, and they will be asked "are you sure?", then upon 
affirmation an even more horrific image will appear and the user will be asked if they are "positive?" Then upon the 
second affirmative response, the task is moved to the failed list and 3 more tasks of the same category(related to the 
same who or what) of less difficulty will be generated. If the user completes all of their tasks a peaceful image will 
appear.

## Who will use it

Anyone who lives a normal lifestyle and is concerned about the largely unseen repercussion of their day to day actions

## Why is this project of interest to me(the programmer)

I have several motivations:
- Help the **environment** and other in need
- People wan to help but prioritise their day to day
    - A *belief* that people want to help but are often too involved in their life to determine how to best assist those 
    in need
- I would use it
